# Timato
This is a single-view iPhone Pomodoro application. The functionality is as bare as the traditional
Pomodoro technique popularized by [Francesco Cirillo](https://cirillocompany.de/pages/pomodoro-technique "Francesco's Company").
It features a sleek UI with flat color palettes provided by the Chameleon Framework from xyz.
Simply tap to engage in whatever task calls your attention.

# Simple UI
Timato's UI is simple. It consists of a motivational quotation, a timer, and two buttons. 
A green background means the timer is active.

A red background signifies that the timer is paused.

Upon launching the app, users will be met with a simple screen displaying a countdown timer, an inspirational quote,
a 'go' button, and a 'stop' button. The quotation will change when after the completion of a single work-break cycle.

Once the timer is up, the users will receive a UIAlert notifying them that it's time for their break/to get back to work. 
The timer will begin only once the user has tapped "Go"

The app icon was made using the [Tomato icon by Pavel Melnikov from the Noun Project](https://thenounproject.com/search/?q=tomato&i=549764)
